\begin{abstract}
In this work we present a complete (no misses, no duplicates) catalogue for closed, orientable and
prime 3-manifolds induced by plane graphs with a 
bipartition of its edge set (blinks) up to 9 edges. Blinks form a universal encoding for such manifolds. 
We hope that this census becomes as useful for the study of concrete examples of 3-manifolds
as the tables of knots are in the study of knots and links. Along the years we have made an issue
in our computational work that it must be reproducible and independently checked by other researchers. 
Our software is available,
but currently it lacks yet a good documentation and help is welcome to change this. An Wiki open source project
is starting.

\section{Introduction} 

In references \cite{kauffman1994tlr}, \cite{lins2007blink} and \cite{lins1995gca}
we we define and show how a {\em blink}, that is, a plane graph with
an arbitrary partition of its edges (here presented as colors black and gray) induces a well
defined closed oriented 3-manifold. Moreover each such a manifold is induced by a blink (in fact, by infinite blinks).
An {\em $n$-small} is a closed, orientable, and prime
3-manifold is a manifold induced by a blink with at most $n$ edges.
Relative to \cite{lins2007blink} the blinks of next theorem have receive two additions, the representative blinks
$U[1563]$ and $U[2165]$.
This is because the jgqi-classes $9_{126}$ and $9_{199}$ of \cite{lins2007blink} split
into two topological classes. The new content of the present work is to prove that the splitings indeed take place.

We observe that the blinks are enlarged in the appendix, showing them together with the
corresponding blackboard framed links. The notation $n_i$ attached to each blink below,
is the name of its homeomorphism class, not merely its hgqi-class, as in \cite{lins2007blink}. 
\eject
\noindent
This paper establishes the following theorem: 
\begin{theorem}
Given any blink up to 9 edges its space is homeomorphic to precisely one of the 
3-manifolds induced by the 489  blinks below. Morever all of these are pairwise non-homeomorphic.\\

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
 The proof follows from L.Lins' thesis and from the discussion about the lengths of the
 smallest geodesics of the classes $9_{126}$ and $9_{199}$
\end{proof}

\section{The resolution of the doubts left in L. Lins' thesis}
The topological classification of the 9-small spaces was nearly completed in 
\cite{lins2007blink}. This work develops a theory for generating a distinguished
set of blinks named $U_n$ and indexed lexicographically, $U_n[i]$ is the $i$-th such blink.
The relevance of $U_n$ is that it misses no closed, orientable, prime and irreducible
3-manifold which is induced by a blink with $n$-edges. 

The 3-manifolds of \cite{lins2007blink} are classified by homology and the quantum WRT$_r$-invariants
$r=3,\ldots,u$, up to $d$ decimal digits forming $hgqi_u^d$-classes. Our algorithm for computing the 
$WRT_r^d$-invariants are based on the theory developed in \cite{kauffman1994tlr}.

After 6 years we have put our doubts as a Challenge to topologists and 
group algebraists, \cite{linslins2013A}.

\section{Definition of Gem}
For completeness we briefly recall the basic definitions of gem theory, leading to its definition, \cite{lins1995gca}.
A {\em 4-graph} $G$ is a finite bipartite 4-regular graph whose edges are partitioned into 4 colors,
0,1,2, and 3, 
so that at each vertex there is an edge of each color, a proper edge-coloration, \cite{bondy1976gta}.
For each $i \in \{0,1,2,3\}$, let $E_i$ denote the set of $i$-colored edges of $G$.
A $\{j,k\}$-residue in a $4$-graph $G$ is a connected component of the subgraph induced by $E_j \cup E_k$.
A 2-residue is a $\{j,k\}$-residue, for some distinct colors $j$ and $k$.
A {\em gem} is a 4-graph $G$ such that for each color $i$, $G\backslash E_i$ can be embedded in the plane 
such that the boundary of each face is a 2-residue. From a gem there exists a straightforward
algorithm to obtain a closed orientable 3-manifold, in two different, dual ways. Every such a manifold is obtainable in this way.
An unecessary big gem is obtained from a triangulation $T$ for a manifold by taking the dual of the 
barycentric subdivision of $T$. Here the colors corresponds to the dimensions. Doing simplifications in the gem
completely destroys this correspondence.

\section{Conclusion}
A closed orientable 3-manifold is denoted {\em $n$-small} if it is induced by surgery on
a blackboard framed link with at most $n$ crossings.
Our bet is that both pairs of 3-manifolds in the 2 first sections of 
this short note are not homeomorphic. This would mean that the $9$-small manifolds are
completely classified and that
the combinatorial dynamics of Chapter 4 in \cite{lins1995gca} based 
on $TS$-moves which leads to a  (small, in the case of hyperbolic 3-manifolds)
number of minimal gems, named the {\em attractor of
the 3-manifold} is successful. This induces an efficient algorithm which 
is capable of classifying topologically all the 3-manifolds given as a blackboard framed link
with up to (so far) 9 crossings and maintains live the two Conjectures of page 15 of \cite{lins1995gca}:
the $TS$- and $u^n$-moves yield an efficient algorithm
to classify $n$-small 3-manifolds by explicitly displaying homeomorphisms, whenever they exist.
